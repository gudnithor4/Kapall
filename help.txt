ABOUT THE GAME
------------------
There are 35 cards on the table (7 cards in 5 rows).
In the beginning the deck in the lower left corner [called "A"]
includes 17 cards that all face down.
You can click on A and the top card will be put face up right 
beside A so there will be a new deck of cards that all face up
[lets call this deck "B"].
Now you can take card of 1 rank lower or 1 rank higher from the
table and drag it onto the top card in B.
Note that a Dolan can be placed onto a Pruto and vice versa.
