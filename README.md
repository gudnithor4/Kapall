Dolan Solitaire
======

There are 35 cards on the table (5 cards in 7 rows).
In the beginning the deck in the lower left corner
(called "A") includes 17 cards that all face down.
You can click on A and the top card will be put face up
right beside A so there will be a new deck of cards that
all face up (lets call this deck "B").
Now you can take card of 1 rank lower or 1 rank higher
from the table and drag it onto the top card in B.
Note that a Dolan can be placed onto a Pruto 
and vice versa.
Also the "Wild Card" can be placed on any card and
any card can be placed on the "Wild Card".
